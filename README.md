In these seiries of jupyter notebooks combine both python coding and statistical concepts applied into analyzing financial data, such as stock data.

Topics we tackle using python:

- Manipulate the existing financial data by generating new variables using multiple columns.

- Recall and apply the important statistical concepts (random variable, frequency, distribution, population and sample, confidence interval, linear regression, etc. ) into financial contexts.

- Build a trading model using multiple linear regression model .

- Evaluate the performance of the trading model using different investment indicators.
